* Rendering custom formats for data with the DetailsList component such as links for Entity References, email addresses, and phone numbers.
* Displaying field data for related entities.
* React Hooks - the component uses both useState and useEffect.
* Loading more than 5k records in DataSet.
* Retaining the use of the standard ribbon buttons by using the setSelectedRecordIds function on the DataSet.
